<p>If you are a Windows Home user, you will not be able install the Docker for Windows Desktop edition, as it requires Hyper-V virtualization. This is supported only by Windows Professional and Enterprise editions.</p><p><strong>Windows Home users will need to install Docker Toolbox </strong>which uses VirtualBox instead. </p><p>Docs and setup info available here:<br><a href="https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/</a></p><p>Release downloads available here:<br><a href="https://github.com/docker/toolbox/releases" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/docker/toolbox/releases</a></p><p>Toolbox will install everything you need including VirtualBox.</p><p>You may also need to enable virtualization in your computer's BIOS&nbsp;settings. This will be different for each manufacturer, please refer to their documentation on which keys to use to access these settings on reboot.</p><p>After Toolbox is finished installing, open the Docker Quickstart Terminal. This will complete the setup and provision your VirtualBox machine.</p><p><strong>Check your install:</strong></p><p>In the Docker QuickStart terminal</p><p><code>docker run hello-world </code></p><p>This should pull down the test container and print hello-world to your screen.</p><p><strong>*Note*</strong></p><p>A major difference between the course lecture using Docker Desktop vs. Docker Toolbox is that you will not be able to use localhost anymore. </p><p>Instead, you will need to access your machine with the IP&nbsp;address <strong>192.168.99.100</strong></p>
